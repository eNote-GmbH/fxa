## Why these fonts?

These fonts are used to generate recovery key PDFs client-side with @react-pdf.

## Why Noto?

Noto is a collection of fonts with multiple weights and widths in sans, serif, mono, and other styles. this family of fonts supports more than 1,000 languages and over 150 writing systems.

For most of the locales supported by Firefox accounts (see `supportedLanguages.json`), we can default to the standard Noto Sans, with a few exceptions that require specific fonts:

- Chinese: Noto Sans SC
- Georgian: Noto Sans Georgian
- Hebrew: Noto Sans Hebrew
- Japanese: Noto Sans JP
- Korean: Noto Sans KR
- Punjabi: Noto Sans Gurmukhi
- Thai: Noto Sans Thai

## Adding new fonts/locales for PDF localization

New fonts (e.g., for additional languages or font weights/styles) must be uploaded to the CDN then registered for use by react-pdf.

1. Add required font files to `assets/fonts`
2. Verify if new file types need to be included in the `upload-assets-to-cdn` script. Currently, `*.ttf` and `*.otf` are included - if the fonts have another extension, add it to the upload script for both stage and prod.
3. Submit the PR, get it approved and merge to upload the assets.
4. Once upload, font urls will start with `https://accounts-static.cdn.mozilla.net/fonts/`
5. Add a case in `ButtonDownloadRecoveryPDF/index.tsx` for the new font(s) (see exisiting examples in the file and consult react-pdf docs: https://react-pdf.org/fonts#register).
